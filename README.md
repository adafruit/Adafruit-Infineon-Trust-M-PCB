### Description

This is a STEMMA I2C breakout for the Infineon OPTIGA TRUST M SLS 32AIA.

OPTIGA Trust M is the next generation of Trust X. OPTIGA Trust M brings RSA 1K/2K + ECC256/384.

A crypto authentication chip much like the ATECC608 STEMMA we put into the shop last week, but with: ECC NIST P256/P384, SHA-256, TRNG, DRNG, RSA® 1024/2048 and 4.5K of user memory.

This chip can store your private keys securely, as well as generate true random numbers, which is what we’ve got going on in this demo below. Check out https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-m for the Arduino library

Comes with a bit of 0.1" standard header in case you want to use it with a breadboard or perfboard.  Four 2.5mm (0.1") mounting holes for easy attachment. Clear Padlock and STEMMA QT cable not included (but we have them in the shop). One board per order.
